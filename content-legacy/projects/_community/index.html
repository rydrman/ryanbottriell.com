<h1>Community</h1>
<p>In the spring of 2014, I took a class in collaboration with the Carleton school of Journalism on Advanced Multimedia Storytelling. Our goal was to create an interactive journalism piece.</p></br>
<p>We chose to visit an intentional community in the state of New York, so we packed up our equipment and headed down. The whole process was an amazing experience.</p></br>
<p>The final product is an interactive website about the beatiful Birdsfoot Farm. The site was designed to highlight the simplicity of life on the farm, and also contrast it with the technological world that we live in (multimedia components).</p></br>
<p>I was involved with the design of the project, but my main contribution was as the main developer of the site and its interactivity.</p></br>
<p>The final site can be found here: <a target='_blank' href="http://community.ryanbottriell.com">community.ryanbottriell.com</a></p></br>
