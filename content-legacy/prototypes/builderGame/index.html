<p>I have always had a special love for 2d management and building games. Before going into my final year of University, I started a project to see if I could build a viable game of this genre in the web browser using HTML5 canvas drawing. I didn't get to much farther than some AI which build walls, but feel free to <a target="_blank" href="{$base}/builderGame.html">check it out</a> nontheless.</p></br>

<p>Use the midle mouse button to click and drag the camera as well as zooming in and out.</p>
