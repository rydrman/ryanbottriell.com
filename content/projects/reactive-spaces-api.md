Reactive Spaces is an API for developing distributed Kinect apps in the web browser. <!--more-->

Building off of the ideas of our previous project [Reactive Space](/projects/reactive-space) my team and I set out to create an API for developing distributed Kinect apps in the web browser.

My role in this project was as the API developer. I also supported the development of the demo game. There are 3 parts to the API project: the desktop application written in c#/.NET; the server code written in JavaScript for Node.js; and the API written in JavasScript for the web browser. The API website and documentation can also be found at [rsapi.ryanbottriell.com](http://rsapi.ryanbottriell.com).
