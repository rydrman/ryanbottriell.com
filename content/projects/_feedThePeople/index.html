<h1>Feed The People</h1>
<p>In 2012 a group of my peers and I built this game for the Microsoft Imagine Cup. 
    The Imagine Cup is and international competiton with different sections, one of which being game design.</p>
</br>
<p>Feed the People is a physics-based game built in XNA for the Windows Phone 7 platform. The idea was that through advertising revenues, players' time in the game could be turned into real charitable donations.
   Feed the People was designed to challenge its players as a global community to reach global score milestones. When milestones are reached, a lump sum would be donated to a charity involved with feeding the hungry.</p>
</br>

<p>Feed the People won second place in the canadian national finals of the Imagine Cup 2012.</p>
</br>

<p>Feed the People can be found on the Windows Phone app store here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/feed-the-people/8e22725e-fabd-43c8-a5a2-c5e43beb5484">Feed the People</a>. Due to lack of resources, the advertising and donation features do not exist in the published version.</p>
