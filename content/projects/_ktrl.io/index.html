<h1>Ktrl.io</h1>
<p>Ktrl.io is a cloud-based asset management and automation tool. It is still currently in development, with only a proof of concept (POC) completed thus far. The system uses cloud-based object storage to store arbitrary, versioned asset data and a distributed database to store associated, user-defined JSON metadata. The POC was built for deployment onto the Google Cloud Platform, although the eventual goal would be to allow deployment into and across many cloud providers.</p></br>
<p>My main technical contributions to this project are ktrlgo and ktrlpy; client APIs for the ktrl.io system written in Go and Python2.7, respectively. These APIs allow developers to read and download existing assets as well as create and upload new assets. These two API implementations help to showcase by ability to write idiomatic code in multiple languages for the same logic.</p></br>
