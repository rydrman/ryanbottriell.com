Another End is my senior project for my bachelors degree at Carleton University in Interactive Multimedia &amp; Design.  <!--more-->

It is a procedurally-generated, story-driven adventure game for the web browser. My role on this project was to build the entire client end of the game, which involves a JavaScript game engine (built on three.js) as well as all of the gameplay, UI, shaders, and input-output development (mouse and keyboard controls, Oculus Rift, and LEAP Motion).

Please check out the games website at [anotherend.com](http://www.anotherend.com). There you will find more details about the development, and design of the game.

Also take a look at our [design document](/another-end/AnotherEnd_DesignDoc.pdf)
