<h1>Reactive Space</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Reactive Space is a digital art installation designed for high-traffic, public spaces.</p><br/>

<p>There are two aspects to the Reactive Space project. One is an active interaction throught the Microsoft Kinect, and the other is a passive interaction through a webcam.
   The webcam tracks movement of people through the space and uses this data to move parts of the simulation around. By doing this we incorporate the actions of anyone passing by.
   When the simulation catches someones attention, they can then approach the screen and actively interact with the simulation using the movement of their hands.</p><br/>

<p>On this project I was the developer, and helped with some interaction design aspects as well. Reactive Space was written in C++ and built using <a target='_blank' href="http://www.openframeworks.cc/">openFrameworks</a>.</p>
