<p>Another End is my senior project for my bachelors degree at Carleton University in Interactive Multimedia &amp; Design. It is a procedurraly-generated, story-driven adventure game for the web browser. My role on this project was to build the entire client end of the game, which involves a JavaScript game engine (built on three.js) as well as all of the gameplay, UI, shaders, and input-output development (mouse and keyboard controls, Oculus Rift, and LEAP Motion).</p></br>

<p>Please check out, and play the game at <a target='_blank' href="http://www.anotherend.com">anotherend.com</a>. There you will find more details about the development, and design of the game.</p></br>
