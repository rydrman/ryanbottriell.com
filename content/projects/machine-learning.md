A simple game with a learning AI companion that I built in HTML5 / JavaScript. <!--more-->

This is a simple game in which you attempt to collect wealth. My machine learning system called Entity acts as your companion.

Entity learns about the world as you explore and interact with items. Entity will also suggest moves based on what it knows to help accomplish your goal. Entity's memory can be saved and reloaded, but can also be initiated with all of the knowledge about the world to see how it acts differently with more knowledge.

Please try the game below. I also wrote a blog about my research into machine learning which you can find at [machlearn.ryanbottriell.com](http://machlearn.ryanbottriell.com)
