<h1>Solstice Game</h1>
<p>A fun little game made in Flash and Actionscript for Global Game Jam 2012 over the course of 48 hours. The theme of the jam was <a target='_blank' href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros">Ouroboros</a>.
   We took the cyclical idea and settled on the concept for Solstice. The goal of the game is simply to reach the door at the end of the level, but the player has to plan their actions on the first half in order to succeed in the second half.
   If the concept seems unclear, it's usually best to just start playing.</p></br>

<p>The controls take some getting used to, but the game is so unique I like to include it here.</p></br>
