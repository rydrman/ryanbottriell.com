<h1>Public Messenger</h1>
<p>Concept for an interactive installation.</p>
<h2>Project Description:</h2>
<p>The idea that I have for this project is an interactive piece intended for public spaces such as shopping malls or event spaces. The idea is to simulate digital communication over a large space. There would be many stations setup throughout the space, with lines of LED's along the floor connecting them. Essentially, users can send anonymous messages to other stations and watch them travel back and forth via the LED pathways.</p>
<p>A central hub would also be setup which every message would pass through. This would be a place for people to watch the system as a whole.</p>
<h2>Central Hub:</h2>
<p>The central hub would consist of several computers with touch screen monitors. The central hub would essentially display a top down map of the entire space with messages travelling back and forth through the LED pathways. Users could tap on messages and stations to bring up information about them.</p>
<h2>Messaging Stations:</h2>
<p>The messaging stations would consist of a computer and touch screen monitor. Users would be able to see an overview of the entire system, similar to the central hubs (described below) with the added ability of being able to send a message to any other connected station. After sending a message, users could watch it travel to the receiver station. The program would also highlight messages that are travelling through the system and destined for the current machine.</p>
<p>The stations would also start sending automated data (carrying no messages) to each other to keep the system alive and give passer-by's something to look at and get enticed by. These data packets could be represented by a different color or lower intensity of LED light in the floor.</p>
<h2>Maps:</h2>
<p>Because the stations display a map of the space, the stations could theoretically double as general purpose maps for the spaces that they are in as well as the interactive component.</p>
<h2>Prototype:</h2>
<p> Below is a simple running prototype. Click on a station to view info and send messages. NOTE: if you're browser window is not wide enough, the edges of the frame may be cut off.</p>
